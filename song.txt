Eve
You, so alone
May I be with you?
Will you tell me what it is you live for?
You creature of harmony
Far removed from blasphemy
Purity fills your existance
So much joy in you
Caressed and cajoled by me?
My skin so close to you
 
Chorus:
Tell me what your heart says
Eve
How curiosity torments you1
Eve
You, who loses herself in pleasure2
Eve
Red pain in your body, banished
Far away from Wonderland
Eve
